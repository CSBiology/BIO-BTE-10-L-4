"Fig 1: Generating a hierarchical tree structure from a complex data set. Vertical thresholds (yellow, green, violet) generate different cluster numbers.\n",
"\n",
"Clustering methods can be used to group elements of a huge data set based on their similarity. Elements sharing similar properties cluster together and can be \n",
"reported as coherent group. These properties could be e.g. (a) similar gene expression kinetics in time series, (b) similar physicochemical properties, (c) genetic \n",
"similarity measures for phylogenetic trees, etc.\n",
"\n",
"Many clustering algorithms require a predefined cluster number, that has to be provided by the experimenter. The most common approach is _k_-means clustering, \n",
"where _k_ stands for the user defined cluster number. This kind of user interaction can lead to results, that are not objective, but highly influenced by the \n",
"view and expectation of the experimenter. \n",
"\n",
"Hierarchical clustering (_hClust_) does not require such cluster number definition. Instead, _hClust_ reports all possible cluster numbers \n",
"(One big cluster with all elements to n clusters where every element is a singleton in its own cluster) in a tree structure (Fig 1). \n",
"A _hClust_ tree has a single cluster (node) on its root and recursively splits up into clusters of elements that are more similar to each other than \n",
"to elements of other clusters. For generating multiple cluster results with different number of clusters, the clustering has to performed only once. \n",
"Subsequently the tree can be cut at any vertical line which will result in a defined number of clusters.\n",
"\n",
"There are two types of _hClust_: \n",
"\n",
"  - Agglomerative (bottom-up): Each data point is in its own cluster and the nearest ones are merged recursively. It is referred to agglomerative hierarchical clustering (_HAC_)\n",
"\n",
"  - Divisive (top-down): All data points are in the same cluster and you divide the cluster into two that are far away from each other.\n",
"\n",
"  - The presented implementation is an agglomerative type.\n",
"\n",
"\n",
"There are several distance metrics, that can be used as distance function. The commonly used one probably is Euclidean distance. By inverting the distance, you end up with a similarity. High similarities indicate low distances, and vice versa. By calculating the similarities for every element pair, a similarity matrix can be generated.\n",
"\n",
