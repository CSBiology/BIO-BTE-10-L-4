"## Introduction\n",

"### Phylogenetic trees\n",
"\n",
"Phylogenetic trees are diagrams that visualize inferred evolutionary relationships between a set of organisms. Consider this tree diagram:\n",
"\n",
"```\n",
"         ____ A\n",
"       _|\n",
"      | |____ B\n",
"______|\n",
"      |______ C\n",
"```\n",
"\n",
"Ancestors are shown as nodes on the tree, while the leaves represent the respective organisms.\n",
"It tells you that A and B share a common ancestor, and that that ancestor shares a common ancestor with C. \n",
"In other words, A and B are closer related to each other, than each of them to C.\n",
"\n",
"A and B form a _clade_ together with their common ancestor (also known as a _monophyletic group_) - a group of organisms that includes a single ancestor \n",
"and all of its descendents that represent unbroken lines of evolutionary descent. \n",
"\n",
"But based on what information do we construct such trees? There are different classes of approaches to this problem, but to stay beginner-friendy, \n",
"only _distance-based_ methods will be discussed in the scope of this project. For sake of completeness, other approaches include _parsimony_, \n",
"_maximum likelihood_ and _Bayesian approaches_ to searching the possible tree space.\n",
"\n",
"The first step in any (distance-based) phylogenetic tree reconstruction is the selection of the characteristic to infer evolutionary relationships from, \n",
"and subsequently the determination of the phylogenetic distance between the organisms of interest based on that characteristic.\n",
"\n",
"---\n",
"\n",
"### Evolutionary Distance of DNA sequences\n",
"\n",
"Any kind of characteristic of organisms can be used to try to infer phylogenetic relationships - like for example beaks of Darwin finches -\n",
"but DNA sequences have proven to be incredibliy helpful to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, as the nucleotide alphabet is relatively \n",
"simple and sequencing data has reached unparalleled throughput and accuracy. Likewise, there are a wide range of sophisticated methods to \n",
"calculate phylogenetic distance based on DNA sequences. \n",
"\n",
"In the scope of this project, you will take a step back and look at some classic evolutionary models that can be used to model phylogenetic \n",
"distance based on DNA sequences.\n",
"\n",
"A few important bits of jargon for the following chapters:\n",
"\n",
"- DNA substitution mutations can be classified by 2 types:\n",
"    - _Transitions_ are interchanges of two-ring purines (A \u003c\u003e G) or of one-ring pyrimidines (C \u003c\u003e T)\n",
"    - _Transversions_ are interchanges of purine for pyrimidine bases or vice versa (A \u003c\u003e T | A \u003c\u003e C | G \u003c\u003e T | G \u003c\u003e C)\n",
"\n",
"---\n",
"---\n",
"\n",
"#### Proportional distance\n",
"\n",
"The pairwise proportional distance (or _p distance_) is the classical \u0027naive\u0027 approach to estimate pairwise distances between two sequences. \n",
"\n",
"It is simply the ratio between substitution sites and \n",
"\n",
"It does not make any correction for multiple substitutions at the same site, substitution rate biases (for example, differences in the transitional and transversional rates), or differences in evolutionary rates among sites.\n",
"\n",

"## Aim for this project\n",
"\n",
"You understand the following evolutionary distance models and are able to explain the differences between them (required in your final report)\n",
"Also, you implement them in F# for the BioFSharp library:\n",
"\n",
"- Pairwise p Distance\n",
"- JC69 evolutionary distance based on the model by Jukes and Cantor\n",
"- K81 evolutionary distance based on the Kimura two-parameter model\n",
"\n",
"As a demonstration of your implementations, as well as to show the differences between these models,\n",
"You construct at least 10 adequate test sequences of equal length, and construct phyologenetic trees from them. \n",
"Investigate the most interesting and obvious differences, and relate them to the different model assumptions.\n",
"\n",
"Finally, you choose adequate sequences of at least 6 organisms, perform a multiple alignment for them and repeat above process for real-world sequences.\n",
